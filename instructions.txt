How to activate the website:
    1) Activate the virtual environment: 
        - Windows: venv\Scripts\activate 
        - Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    2) Assign the flask app: set FLASK_APP=app.py
    3) Run the flask app: flask run 
    ##### with windows stop here bacause local production is being done without nginx #################
        To make sure the app is running on linux: curl http://localhost:5000 (should see the html page contents)
    4) Activate nginx: navigate to the nginx folder (cd /etc/nginx) and type in the terminal: 
        - Windows: nginx 
        - Linux: sudo service nginx start (or nginx restart)
        For linux check the status to make sure its running: sudo systemctl status nginx

Helpful information:
    1) If the flask app isnt running- remember to activate the venv or try installing flask again 
    2) If the website isn't updating with changes made- in the nginx terminal run the command: Windows: nginx -s reload Linux: sudo service nginx restart
    3) To quit the app in nginx terminal write: Windows: nginx -s quit Linux: sudo systemctl stop nginx
    4) if the app isn't stopping:
        - Windows: go to task manager, locate the PID, and run the command (in any terminal): taskkill /F /PID 14312 (replace 14312 with PID)
        - Linux: locate pid with: pgrep nginx, then stop with: sudo kill <nginx-pid>


Things to pay attention to in production: 
    1) Change nginx configuration files when uploading to the server
    2) "database connection strings, secret keys, or API keys should be stored as environment variables" (in the app.py file)- ChatGPT
    3) When you create a database- save database connection as an environment variable (and any other assignments necessary, ask gpt :)
    4) 





Not sure how helpful it is information:
    1) sites-available: folder that has the conf files of all the websites nginx has acces to 
       sites-enabled: folder (similar to available) but this one is responsible for the live websites (links to the 'available folder' to know which virtual hosts are activated).
